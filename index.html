        <h4 class="om10">JAMIE FLOYD: <span class="span1">UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</span></h4>
        <p class="om11">"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8
            weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
            Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p>

        <p class="om13">"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real
            artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves

        <p class="om15">"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the
            value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home
            improvements."</p>
